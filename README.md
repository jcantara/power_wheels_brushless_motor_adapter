# Power Wheels brushless motor adapter plate
3d printable brushless motor adapter plate for Power Wheels kid cars

OpenSCAD template with variable definitions for easily modifying brushless mount plate for various motors

Variables are currently just placeholders, if you print this as-is, it won't fit anything; not measured. I will update that soon for the powerwheels car I have and hopefully that's somewhat universal.
